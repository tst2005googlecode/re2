RE2 should install on any modern Unix clone with g++.

<pre>
hg clone https://re2.googlecode.com/hg re2<br>
cd re2<br>
make test<br>
make install<br>
make testinstall</pre>
(On BSD systems, use `gmake` instead of `make`.)

No attempt has been made to make RE2 compile on Windows, but if anyone would like to try, patches would be welcomed.

For documentation on how to use RE2, see the comment at the top of <a href='http://code.google.com/p/re2/source/browse/re2/re2.h'>re2/re2.h</a>.
